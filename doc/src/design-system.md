The MGI design system predicates itself on the minimal amount of primatives to represent the majority of operations required by a user interfacing with a computer.

This system is predicated on four or more interfaces:
- an output screen that displays a memory buffer
- a touch device that overlays the output screen 
- an independent touch device that moves a pointer on the hardware screen
- a keyboard that inputs characters into a receptive buffer

We also separate the display elements into primatives. These primatives display a particular state in the current user interface.

## Primatives

There are just three primatives that encompass the MGI design system:

- Container
- Content
- Input
