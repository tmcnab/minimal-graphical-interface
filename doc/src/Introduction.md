The Minimal Graphical Interface is both a design system and a software library that can render it and where possible, simplicity and terseness reigns in the design of both.

The design system espouses a minimal amount of primatives to accomplish the maximal amount of desired input.

The software library renders a graphical interface specification into a pixel buffer in a platform agnostic way.
